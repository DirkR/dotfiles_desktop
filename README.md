# Dotfiles

This is a part of [my](https://github.com/dirkr) dotfiles configuration.
This repo contains the parts needed for desktop workplaces.

See the [original dotfiles repo](https://github.com/dirkr/dotfiles) for
vim/tmux/zsh configuration.

This repo is based on the [dfm](https://github.com/justone/dfm) utility to help
with managing and updating my dotfiles.

## Using this repo

This repo depends on my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/dirkr/dotfiles):

    $ git clone git@github.com:dirkr/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
    $ ~/.dotfiles/bin/dfm install

Finally, to install these dotfiles:

    $ git clone git@github.com:dirkr/dotfiles_desktop ~/.dotfiles_desktop
    $ ~/.dotfiles_desktop/bin/dfm install
